Right now it works like this.


On the first run through the work loop we allocate the fibers
and run one iteration of the repl to get the inital source
after that the loop goes like this:

If there are resumeable tasks try to make progress on them
by trying to finish them, we try to finish the pending tasks at most 2 times 
after that we assume that we are dependent on work which has not been schduled yet
so we pull from the taskQueue
then we try to execute the task we just pulled if there was one

at the end we run the repl fiber again to get more source code
